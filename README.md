# gut ü§î‚û°Ô∏èüîß

**gut** is a simple and witty command-line wrapper around `git` for those moments when you accidentally type "gut" instead of "git". Instead of getting a "command not found" error, gut will give you a friendly, humorous message and then execute your intended git command.

## Features

- üé≠ **Witty Messages**: Displays random humorous quotes about your typo
- üîÑ **Seamless Forwarding**: Passes all arguments directly to git
- ‚ùå **Smart Error Handling**: Helpful instructions if git is not installed
- üåç **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚ö° **Lightweight**: Small, fast, and simple

### Manual Installation

#### 1. Download Pre-built Binaries

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/geraldnguyen/gut/releases):

- **Linux (amd64)**: `gut-linux-amd64`
- **Linux (arm64)**: `gut-linux-arm64`

# Move to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv gut-* /usr/local/bin/gut
```

##### Windows

```

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or later
- Make (optional, for using the Makefile)

#### Build Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/geraldnguyen/gut.git
cd gut

# Build for current platform
make build

# Or build for all platforms
make build-all

# Install locally (Linux/macOS)
make install
```

## Usage

Simply use `gut` exactly as you would use `git`:

```bash
# Instead of getting "command not found", you get:
gut status
# üòÑ 'gut' feeling tells me you meant 'git'! Let me fix that for you...
# 
# On branch main
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
# ...

gut add .
# üéØ Close! You typed 'gut' but I think you meant 'git'. Forwarding your command...
# 

gut commit -m "Fix typo"
# üí° 'gut' reaction: this should be 'git'! No worries, I've got you covered.
# [main a1b2c3d] Fix typo
# ...
```

All git functionality works exactly the same - gut just adds a friendly message before executing your command.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic git commands work exactly the same
gut clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
gut pull origin main
gut push origin feature-branch
gut log --oneline
gut diff HEAD~1

# Advanced git commands too
gut rebase -i HEAD~3
gut cherry-pick abc123
gut bisect start
```
